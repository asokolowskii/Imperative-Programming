# ðŸ§  Imperative Programming â€“ C Language Practice & Fundamentals

This repository contains laboratory exercises, solutions, and practical notes from the **Imperative Programming** course at AGH University of Krakow. The course focuses on mastering the C programming language and understanding core concepts of imperative programming: control flow, data structures, memory management, and file operations.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Course Scope

The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and hands-on programming in C, including:

- Writing structured programs using functions, conditionals, and loops
- Understanding pointers, arrays, and strings
- Working with user-defined types: structs, unions, enums
- Memory management with `malloc`, `calloc`, `free`
- Using the C Standard Library effectively
- Performing file I/O (text and binary files)
- Building programs using Makefiles
- Working with dynamic data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

By completing this course, students will be able to:

- Implement well-structured, readable, and efficient programs in C
- Apply basic and advanced features of the C language
- Use dynamic memory management properly
- Handle input/output operations with files
- Understand the internal representation of data and pointers
- Develop simple data structures and algorithms (sorting, searching, traversal)
